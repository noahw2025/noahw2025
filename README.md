Hi my names Noah Walker currently exploring my passions in different fields of computer science through formal education aswell as selfstudying through projects, focussing on real world application and use cases within my interests, this profile displays some of the bigger more time consuming things ive worked on that are code based instead of hardware(website has other projects). The goal of this github is to not only show my progress throughout my self learning and guided education, but to fully show my passion and scope of knowledge in the field from the different projects and applied learning throughout the past 4 years. Im looking to find more direction and gain hands on experience, for the time being im practicing and gaining more experience so im prepared when entering the job industry.
How to reach me: nwalker31@student.gsu.edu
